# PythonDiscordCoinFlipBot
Simple python discord bot that just flips a coin.
--------------------
This bot came to be through me and my friend's indecision. We like to watch movies in discord yet never can choose one, thus this bot lets us flip a coin in the channel to decide between two movies.
--------------------
There is a commented out functionality at the bottom of the program to choose two movies randomly out of a text channel called movie-queue. If you choose to use this make sure that you enter movies as a single message.
